# Life Philosophy Curriculum — Product Plan

> Upgrade your mental operating system with the timeless code of the masters.

## One-liner
A curated audio + AI platform that teaches adults how humanity's greatest thinkers answered life's hardest questions — 15 min/day, at their own pace.

## The Problem
- 100M+ Americans are spiritual but not religious — they have questions, no product
- 3-10% MOOC completion rates — lectures don't work
- ChatGPT has the answers but nobody wants to build their own curriculum
- People are spending billions on pieces of this (meditation apps, self-help books, therapy) but nobody offers the integrated package

## The Product

### Free: The Interview (acquisition engine)
- 10-20 min AI conversation asking 7 life questions
- User talks 70%, AI listens and probes
- Generates a "philosophical profile" — which traditions you resonate with, your blind spots, your contradictions
- Shareable report = viral loop
- Last question: "What do you want to understand better?" → maps to starting module

### Paid  The Curriculum
7 modules, each built around one life question:

| # | Question | Search Demand |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Why am I anxious and how do I stop? | 2-3M/mo |
| 2 | Why do I feel alone even around people? | 1-1.5M/mo |
| 3 | What should I do with my life? | 500K+/mo |
| 4 | What do I do when everything falls apart? | 400K+/mo |
| 5 | How do I think about death? | 400K+/mo |
| 6 | How do I know what's true? | 200K+/mo |
| 7 | What do I actually believe? | Integration module |

### Each module = 4 weeks:
1. **Podcast ep 1** — The question (why it matters, 10-15 min)
2. **Podcast ep 2** — Eastern answers (Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism) + thinker summary cards
3. **Podcast ep 3** — Western answers (Stoicism, Existentialism, Christianity) + thinker summary cards
4. **Podcast ep 4** — Modern science (psychology, CBT, neuroscience) + personal toolkit

The podcast and text summary generated is tailored to the users answers. so it meets them where they are and explores topics they are not familiar with.

## Format = Buffet, Not Dogma
Each question is answered by 5+ traditions. User learns all of them, picks what fits. Not "here's THE answer" — "here's what humanity came up with, build your own toolkit."

## Why Not Just ChatGPT?
- Curated audio you press play on (not a blank prompt)
- Produced stories, not walls of text
- Sequenced curriculum with progression
- Remembers you across months
- Bounded and finishable 


## Go-To-Market (no existing audience needed)
1. Build the free interview as a single-page web app
2. Post short clips of fascinating AI philosophy dialogues on social
3. SEO on life questions ("how to deal with suffering stoicism vs buddhism")

## V1 Scope
