# Marketing Strategy — Life Philosophy Curriculum
### Based on Cialdini's *Influence* and *Pre-Suasion*

## The Core Insight: Your Free Interview IS Your Pre-Suasion

You've accidentally designed one of the best pre-suasion tools I've seen. The AI interview that asks 7 life questions is not just a lead magnet — it's a **privileged moment factory**. Here's why:

- It forces people to **articulate their pain** out loud (channeled attention)
- It makes them **confront their blind spots** (the threatening / self-relevant)
- It leaves them with an **unfinished loop** ("What do you want to understand better?")
- It generates a **personalized artifact** they feel ownership over (commitment)

The entire battle is won or lost based on how well you execute that interview. Everything else is downstream.

## The Launch Strategy, Mapped to Cialdini

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (4-6 weeks out) — Be an Opener, Not a Closer

**Reciprocity + Authority**
- Don't announce the product yet. Instead, publish 3-5 short-form pieces comparing how different traditions answer the same question. Example: *"How Stoics, Buddhists, and CBT therapists all treat anxiety — and where they disagree."* This is genuinely useful content that builds debt AND positions you as someone who has done the synthesis work nobody else has done.
- These pieces double as SEO plays against your high-volume search terms (2-3M/mo for anxiety alone).

**Unity — Ask for Advice, Not Opinions**
- Email or DM 50-100 people in the "spiritual but not religious" space. Don't say "what do you think of this idea." Say: **"I need your advice on something — I'm building a curriculum that teaches philosophy through audio, and I'm stuck on which life question to lead with. Can I get your take?"** Cialdini's research shows "advice" specifically creates identity-merging. These people become psychologically invested in your success.

**Mystery + Unfinished Loops**
- Post short clips of the AI interview in action — but only the *questions*, not the answers. Show someone being asked "What do you do when everything falls apart?" and their face as they think. Cut before the answer. The open loop drives engagement and curiosity.

### Phase 2: The Interview Launch (Week of) — The Real Product Is Free

**This is the most important insight: Launch the free interview first. Not the paid product.**

The interview is your entire funnel. Here's how to maximize it:

**Commitment & Consistency**
- The interview asks 7 life questions. Each answer is a micro-commitment. By the time someone finishes, they've spent 15-20 minutes articulating what matters to them. They now have a "philosophical profile" — a written, personalized document that says "you resonate with Stoicism and Buddhism, you have a blind spot around mortality, your biggest contradiction is X."
- That profile creates an identity. They are now **a person who cares about these questions**. The paid curriculum is the consistent next step for that kind of person.

**Social Proof — The Viral Loop**
- The shareable report is good, but make it *specific enough to be interesting and vague enough to provoke curiosity*. Think: "My philosophical profile says I'm 70% Stoic, but I have a blind spot about death that aligns with Buddhist avoidance patterns." That's shareable because it's about identity — people love sharing things that say something about who they are (same reason personality tests go viral).
- Add a line to the report: **"4,312 people have taken the interview. Here's how your profile compares."** Social proof + self-relevance in one sentence.

**Scarcity — Don't Fabricate It, Engineer It**
- You said V1 involves *manually* creating the first podcast and text content. This is actually a gift. It means you have **real, structural scarcity**: "We can only onboard 50 people in our first cohort because every curriculum is hand-crafted." This is true. Use it.
- Founding member pricing tied to this real constraint: "First 50 members get lifetime access at $X/mo because we're personally building each curriculum. Once we automate, the price goes up."

### Phase 3: Converting Interview-Takers to Paid (The Close That Isn't a Close)

**Pre-Suasion — The Interview Already Did the Work**

The last question of the interview is: *"What do you want to understand better?"* This maps to a starting module. The conversion page should literally say:

> "You said you want to understand **why you feel alone even around people.** Here's what we built for you."

Then show Module 2's outline — the 4 weeks, the Eastern answers, the Western answers, the modern science. **This isn't a pitch. It's a completion of the loop they opened.** They asked a question; you're showing them the answer exists.

**Authority + Liking**
- On the conversion page, lead with the thinkers, not the product. "In this module, you'll hear from Marcus Aurelius, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Irvin Yalom — all addressing the question you just asked." The authority of the thinkers transfers to the product.
- Include a 90-second founder video: "I built this because I had these same questions and couldn't find a single place that brought all the answers together." Liking through shared struggle and vulnerability.

**Weakness-First Trust Building**
- Somewhere on the page: "This isn't therapy. It won't replace professional help if you need it. What it will do is give you 2,000 years of humanity's best thinking on the question you're already asking." The honest limitation makes the value claim credible.

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Retention & Word-of-Mouth

**Unity — Cohort Model**
- Don't do evergreen access at launch. Run cohorts. "Cohort 1 starts March 15. Everyone starts Module 1 together." Synchronous shared experience creates bonds. People who go through existential questions together form real community — this is the same reason group therapy works better than solo for many people.

**Consistency — Reference Their Own Words**
- Throughout the curriculum, reference what they said in the interview. "You mentioned that you struggle with [X]. This week's episode addresses that directly through the lens of Taoism." They can't dismiss it — they said it themselves.

**Reciprocity — Ongoing Unexpected Value**
- After someone finishes a module, send them a free "thinker card" for someone they didn't cover. No upsell, no CTA. Just a gift. This keeps the reciprocity loop alive and makes the next module purchase feel natural.

## The Channels That Actually Work for This

1. **SEO (long game, high ceiling)**: Your search demand numbers are enormous. "How to deal with anxiety stoicism vs buddhism" is a long-tail goldmine. Every comparison piece ranks AND pre-sells the product's core value prop (the buffet, not dogma).

2. **Short-form video (medium game)**: Clips of the AI interview in action, or 60-second "here's how 3 traditions answer the same question" explainers. The content format *is* the product demo.

3. **Podcast guesting (quick wins)**: There are hundreds of podcasts in the "meaning/purpose/philosophy for modern people" space. Your pitch is easy: "I built a tool that gives people a philosophical profile in 15 minutes." Every host will want to try it live on air.

4. **The interview as paid acquisition**: Run ads that lead directly to the free interview. Not to a landing page. Not to a blog post. Straight to the experience. The interview *is* the ad. Your CAC is the cost of one completed interview, and the conversion rate from completed interview to paid should be high because of all the pre-suasion built into the experience.

## What to Prioritize

Highest-leverage things to nail, ranked:

1. **The interview experience** — This is your entire pre-suasion engine. Every dollar and hour spent making it better has the highest ROI.
2. **The shareable profile** — This is your growth loop. If it's interesting enough to screenshot and post, you have organic distribution.
3. **The first cohort with real scarcity** — 50 people, hand-crafted, founding price. Real constraint = real urgency.
4. **3-5 SEO comparison pieces** — Long-tail content that compounds and doubles as authority-building.

Everything else is optimization on top of those four.
